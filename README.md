## About this fork

This is a fork of [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline). It ships the VS Code extension as a VSIX on its [GitHub releases](https://github.com/vsalomaki/cline/releases). Release versions look like `4.1.24+vsa.N`, where `4.1.24` is the upstream version.

- **Privacy:** Fork builds send no telemetry and make no Cline-service calls. There is no account sign-in, no background model-catalog or marketplace fetches, and no CLI self-update.
- **Agent behaviour and prompt:**
  - The act prompt is reworked. Your instructions stay in effect across turns, and ALL CAPS text in them is read as emphasis.
  - Review before finishing: in act mode the agent goes over the files it changed once before it reports done. On by default.
  - Point out reverted edits: the agent is told when an edit puts a file back the way it was a few edits earlier. On by default.
  - Loop-detection warnings reach the agent, and the Retries setting caps every retry layer.
- **Context and compaction:** Compaction keeps your messages verbatim. Its summary adds "User instructions" and "Decisions and rejected approaches" sections. Compaction triggers on the provider's token count. "Summary input per block" and "Summary length" are adjustable in Agent Limits.
- **Tools:**
  - The editor tool accepts a whole file in one call.
  - A `list_files` tool gives a `.gitignore`-aware directory listing, with an optional glob pattern.
  - Tool input and output size limits are settings instead of hard-coded values, and tool output is not truncated twice.
  - Read-only tools (read, search, list, fetch) run in parallel, four at a time by default. Set the cap or turn it off in Agent Limits, Tool calls.
  - Read before edit: the agent must read a file before it edits it. On by default.
  - After an edit, new errors and warnings are reported to the agent. Errors only by default. Set in Agent Limits, Language servers.
  - A `code_intelligence` tool gives definitions, references, hover, symbols and diagnostics when a language server is available.
  - Git commands that throw away uncommitted work always ask for approval, even with auto-approve on. Headless runs refuse them.
  - Tool names from other agents, such as `Read`, `Bash` and `Edit`, map to Cline's own tools.
- **Hooks:**
  - Runs Claude Code-style `hooks.json` files. Hooks can block a tool call, rewrite its input, or add context.
  - Events include prompt submit, task start and resume (once per conversation), and pre-compaction.
  - Hook runs that change nothing are hidden from the chat.
  - The hook engine and timeout are in Agent Limits, Hooks.
- **Subagents and teams:**
  - Delegation in Features is Off (default), Subagents, or Agent teams.
  - Subagents run a delegated task in their own context. You approve each handoff. Subagents in VS Code cannot run shell commands.
  - Agent teams keep the lead agent usable while teammates work. Each teammate's status shows in the chat.
  - Nested subagents are off by default. Agent Limits, Subagents turns them on.
- **MCP:** `${env:VAR}` and `${workspaceFolder}` work in MCP server settings.
- **Memory:** Off by default. Turn it on in Features, Memory, or with `--memory` in the CLI. Project memory is kept per git repository, outside the repo, so your project tree stays clean. It saves only hard-won findings, not routine steps.
- **Settings:** Most fork settings are in the VS Code Agent Limits and Features tabs. Full descriptions and defaults are in [`docs/getting-started/config.mdx`](docs/getting-started/config.mdx).

**Install.** Download `cline-<version>.vsix` from the releases page and run `code --install-extension cline-<version>.vsix`. The VSIX keeps upstream's extension ID, so it replaces the Marketplace Cline and shares its settings. Turn off VS Code's auto-update for this extension. Otherwise the next Marketplace release replaces the fork build.

## Edits Code Across Your Project

Cline reads your project structure, understands the relationships between files, and makes coordinated changes across your codebase. It monitors linter and compiler errors as it works, fixing issues like missing imports, type mismatches, and syntax errors before you even see them. In VS Code and JetBrains, every edit shows up as a diff you can review, modify, or revert. All changes are tracked with checkpoints, so you can easily undo the agent's work.

## Runs Bash Commands

Cline executes commands directly in your terminal and watches the output in real time. Install packages, run build scripts, execute tests, deploy applications, manage databases. For long-running processes like dev servers, Cline continues working in the background and reacts to new output as it appears, catching compile errors, test failures, and server crashes as they happen.

## Plan and Act

Toggle between Plan mode and Act mode. In Plan mode, Cline explores your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and lays out a strategy. Once you're aligned, switch to Act mode and Cline executes the plan. Every file edit and terminal command requires your approval, so you stay in control of what actually changes. Or toggle auto-approve and let Cline run autonomously.

## Rules and Skills

Define project-specific rules in `.clinerules` files that guide how Cline works in your codebase: coding standards, architecture conventions, deployment procedures, testing requirements. Rules are picked up automatically by the CLI, VS Code extension, and JetBrains plugin. Use skills to let the model load specific rules when needed.

## Works With Every Model

Cline is not locked to a single AI provider. Use whichever model fits your workflow:

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus, Sonnet, Haiku |
| OpenAI | GPT series models |
| Google | Gemini series models |
| OpenRouter | 200+ models from any provider |
| Vercel AI Gateway | Route to many providers through one gateway |
| AWS Bedrock | Claude, Llama, and more |
| Azure / GCP Vertex | All hosted models |
| Cerebras / Groq | Fast inference models |
| Ollama / LM Studio | Run local models on your machine |
| Any OpenAI-compatible API | Self-hosted or third-party endpoints |

## Extend With Plugins or MCP Servers

Extend Cline's capabilities with plugins. Using the SDK, register tools and lifecycle hooks programmatically through the plugin system for logging, auditing, policy enforcement, or adding domain-specific capabilities. Simple plugin example below.

```typescript
import { Agent, createTool } from "@cline/sdk"

const deployTool = createTool({
  name: "deploy",
  description: "Deploy the current branch to staging.",
  inputSchema: { type: "object", properties: { env: { type: "string" } }, required: ["env"] },
  execute: async (input) => {
    // your deployment logic
  },
})

const agent = new Agent({ tools: [deployTool], /* ... */ })
```
...or use [MCPs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) to connect to databases, query APIs, manage cloud infrastructure, and interact with external systems. Use [community-built servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) or ask Cline to create custom tools on the fly. In the CLI, manage servers with `cline mcp`.

## Multi-Agent Teams

Coordinate multiple agents working together on complex tasks. A coordinator agent breaks the work into subtasks and delegates to specialist agents, each with their own tools and context. Team state persists across sessions so you can pick up where you left off.

```bash
cline --team-name auth-sprint "Plan and implement user authentication with tests"
```

## Scheduled Agents

Run agents on cron schedules for recurring automations. Daily PR summaries, weekly dependency checks, codebase health reports. Schedules persist across restarts and run independently of any terminal session.

```bash
cline schedule create "PR summary" \
  --cron "0 9 * * MON-FRI" \
  --prompt "List all open PRs and their review status" \
  --workspace /path/to/repo
```

## Connect to Slack, Telegram, Discord, and More

Chat with your agent from any messaging platform: Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, WhatsApp, and Linear. Each conversation thread maps to an agent session with full context. Set up access control to restrict who can interact with your agent.

```bash
# Connect to Telegram
cline connect telegram -k $BOT_TOKEN
# Connect to Slack through webhook
cline connect slack --bot-token $SLACK_TOKEN --signing-secret $SECRET --base-url $URL
# Connect to Slack using socket mode
cline connect slack --bot-token $SLACK_TOKEN --app-token $SLACK_APP_TOKEN
```

## Headless CLI for CI/CD

Run Cline with zero interaction for scripting and automation. Pipe input, get JSON output, chain commands, integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

```bash
cline "Run tests and fix any failures"
git diff origin/main | cline "Review these changes for issues"
cline --json "List all TODO comments" | jq -r 'select(.type == "agent_event" and .event.text) | .event.text'
```
